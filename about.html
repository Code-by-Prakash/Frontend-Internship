    <h2>About us</h2>
    <p align="justify"><b>Government Arts College, Nandanam, Chennai- 600 035</b>, had originated in the middle of the 18th century as a
        School, called Madrasa, and in 1901, it was upgraded into a College with the objective of accommodating Muslim
        students, which continued till it acquired its present status in 1948. Ever since, equal opportunity came to be
        extended to students of all communities, irrespective of religious denomination.

        At its present location, it is well situated to serve the needs of the pupils settled in the central regions of
        the Metropolis. Though it is situated in Chennai, it draws students from the neighboring districts. A distinct
        character of the Institution is that it caters to the needs of the lower rungs of the society.
